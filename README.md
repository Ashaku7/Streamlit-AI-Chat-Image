# AI Multi-Modal Assistant

This project is a Streamlit-based AI-powered multi-modal assistant that combines a Text Chat Assistant and an Image Generator Bot in a single web application. It leverages Google Generative AI for conversational text assistance and Stability AI's Stable Diffusion models for image generation from text prompts.
